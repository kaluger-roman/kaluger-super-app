## Codex execution contract

Read the complete procedure below before executing this skill. `$ARGUMENTS` means
arguments/instructions in the user's invocation; it is not a literal environment
variable or shell fragment. Slash-command spellings in older chats map to the
corresponding `$skill-name`; execute the skill's instructions with available tools.

- Read root/nested `AGENTS.md`, applicable conventions and `docs/codex-workflow.md`.
  Work on this Mac. Resolve a supplied `--worktree PATH` to that checkout; otherwise
  use the assigned checkout. Use local `git -C <checkout>`, worktree-local dependencies,
  Docker databases and ports from `scripts/dev-stack.sh`; never connect to `home`,
  use SSH/sshfs, symlink `node_modules`, or test against real production data.
- Task setup, draft PR, commits/pushes and CI follow the current global workflow.
  Keep an assigned worktree and never nest one; a new task from the main checkout
  uses its isolated local worktree under that workflow. Preserve unrelated changes.
  Explicit report/draft/read-only modes retain their own no-publication boundaries.
  `news`, ready-for-review, merge and deploy require their own explicit instruction.
- Before GitHub operations resolve origin and verify `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,url`.
  Pass `--repo OWNER/REPO` or set a verified task-local `GH_REPO`; never trust a repository
  mentioned only in issue/spec text. Ambiguous write failures require read-back before retry.
- For prescribed parallel workers follow `docs/subagents.md`: inherit the configured
  Codex model, use maximum supported reasoning effort for analysis/coding/review,
  dispatch independent roles concurrently up to available slots and queue the rest.
  Never replace a required role with a silent omission; report unavailable coverage.
  Scoring and browser QA may use the inherited default effort. Workers must not
  recursively invoke the orchestration skill they are executing for the parent.
- User decisions already given in this chat satisfy the matching checkpoint. Ask
  only for missing consequential choices via an available question tool; when none
  is available, use a clear final question and resume from recorded artifacts after
  the answer. A missing answer is not authorization. Do independent work while waiting.
- Run shell commands shown as examples deliberately, with proper argv/quoting.
  Prefer `rg`/`rg --files` for searches; do not copy a placeholder literally.
  Report observed results only. Existing specs/reports do not override live config.

## Feature identity and local setup

Resolve the exact `specs/<NNN-name>/` folder from explicit input or `SPECIFY_FEATURE`.
`feature_slug` is `NNN-name`; `branch` is the actual Git branch (usually
`codex/NNN-name` or the already assigned branch). Never use the branch including
`codex/` as a specs path. A detached HEAD or an ambiguous numeric prefix is not a
feature identity. Set `SPECIFY_FEATURE=<feature_slug>` for every helper when the
branch differs. Return `branch`, `feature_slug` and `spec_path` separately.
Use the artifact language already established in the spec; communicate with the user in Russian.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Identify inconsistencies, duplications, ambiguities, and underspecified items across the three core artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) before implementation. This command MUST run only after `$speckit-tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.

## Operating Constraints

**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).

**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `$speckit-analyze`.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Initialize Analysis Context

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:

- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md
- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md
- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md

Abort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).
For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)

Load only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:

**From spec.md:**

- Overview/Context
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- User Stories
- Edge Cases (if present)

**From plan.md:**

- Architecture/stack choices
- Data Model references
- Phases
- Technical constraints

**From tasks.md:**

- Task IDs
- Descriptions
- Phase grouping
- Parallel markers [P]
- Referenced file paths

**From constitution:**

- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation

### 3. Build Semantic Models

Create internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):

- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., "User can upload file" → `user-can-upload-file`)
- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria
- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)
- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements

### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)

Focus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.

#### A. Duplication Detection

- Identify near-duplicate requirements
- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation

#### B. Ambiguity Detection

- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria
- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)

#### C. Underspecification

- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome
- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment
- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan

#### D. Constitution Alignment

- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle
- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution

#### E. Coverage Gaps

- Requirements with zero associated tasks
- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story
- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)

#### F. Inconsistency

- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)
- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)
- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)
- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)

### 5. Severity Assignment

Use this heuristic to prioritize findings:

- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality
- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion
- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case
- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order

### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report

Output a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:

## Specification Analysis Report

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |

(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)

**Coverage Summary Table:**

| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|

**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)

**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)

**Metrics:**

- Total Requirements
- Total Tasks
- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)
- Ambiguity Count
- Duplication Count
- Critical Issues Count

### 7. Provide Next Actions

At end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:

- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `$speckit-implement`
- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions
- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., "Run $speckit-specify with refinement", "Run $speckit-plan to adjust architecture", "Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'"

### 8. Offer Remediation

Ask the user: "Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)

## Operating Principles

### Context Efficiency

- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation
- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis
- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow
- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts

### Analysis Guidelines

- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)
- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)
- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)
- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)
- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)
